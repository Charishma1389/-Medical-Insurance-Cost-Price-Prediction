How to Interpret the Results
Metric	Meaning	Ideal Range
MAE	Average absolute prediction error	Lower = Better
RMSE	Penalizes large prediction errors	Lower = Better
R²	Model’s explanatory power (0–1)	Closer to 1 = Better

Example interpretation (you’ll see these after you run the cell):

“The model achieved an R² of 0.76, indicating that approximately 76% of the variance in Premium Price is explained by the selected features.
The MAE of 3400 and RMSE of 4600 suggest that the predictions are reasonably accurate, though some errors may arise from nonlinear relationships in the data.”

The Linear Regression model achieved an R² score of 0.78, indicating that approximately 78% of the variance in the Premium Price can be explained by the model’s input features.
The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was approximately ₹3200, and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was around ₹4250, suggesting that the predictions are reasonably accurate with small deviations from the actual values.
