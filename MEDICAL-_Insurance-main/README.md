How to Interpret the Results
Metric	Meaning	Ideal Range
MAE	Average absolute prediction error	Lower = Better
RMSE	Penalizes large prediction errors	Lower = Better
R²	Model’s explanatory power (0–1)	Closer to 1 = Better

Example interpretation (you’ll see these after you run the cell):

“The model achieved an R² of 0.76, indicating that approximately 76% of the variance in Premium Price is explained by the selected features.
The MAE of 3400 and RMSE of 4600 suggest that the predictions are reasonably accurate, though some errors may arise from nonlinear relationships in the data.”
